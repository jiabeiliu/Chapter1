Non-programming Assignment:
How does a natural neuron work? A natural neuron consists of dendrites, a cell body (soma), and an axon. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons in the form of electrical impulses. Once the accumulated input at the cell body exceeds a threshold, the neuron becomes "excited" and fires an action potential. This action potential travels down the axon and is transmitted to the next neuron through synapses​(01_brain_neuron_model)​(03_perceptron_logistic_…).

How does a natural neuron transmit signals to other neurons? A natural neuron transmits signals via synapses. When the electrical potential in a neuron reaches a synapse, neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. These chemicals then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, potentially triggering a new action potential if the signal strength exceeds the required threshold​(01_brain_neuron_model).

Describe the McCulloch and Pitts model of an artificial neuron. The McCulloch and Pitts model, developed in 1943, is the first mathematical model of a neuron. In this model, the neuron aggregates input signals and produces an output if the sum of the inputs exceeds a certain threshold. Each input signal is either 0 or 1, and if the total input exceeds the threshold, the neuron "fires" and generates a binary output (0 or 1). The model is the basis for modern artificial neurons in neural networks​(01_brain_neuron_model)​(02_perceptron).
